          My wrestling career started when I was only 4 years old, my dad had already introduced my older brother
          to the sport, and he loved it, so naturally I wanted to follow my brother. Ever since I first steped on
          a wrestling mat I knew that it was just where I was meant to be. Everything about the sport was just hard
          and so tough on the body, but the feeling of winning through hard work and truly testing your limits against
          others is unlike anything else I have experienced in life. I wrestled in High School for Buchanan High School,
          in the four years I was there my team won the california state team title all four years, and I was a part of the
          starting line up three of those times and I placed 7th(sophomore year) and 2nd(senior year) in the state. I was
          also a national runner-up my junior year. I decided to come to CBU to be a part of their wrestling team and to
          grow in my faith with Christ. Through my time here I have already beaten two top 15 wrestlers in the nation and
          fell one point short of qualifying for the NCAA tournament. Wrestling has taught me countless life lessons
          that I will carry with me the rest of my life and I will forever be grateful to the sport that allows me to push
          past my limits every time I step out there.
